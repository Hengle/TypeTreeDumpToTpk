# Type Tree Dump to Tpk

Uses ds5678's [TypeTreeDumps repository](https://github.com/ds5678/TypeTreeDumps) to produce UABE classdata.tpk files.

# How to use

Run the program and it will automatically download the repository and build two tpks, one for release and one for editor. (Although they both seem to be the same right now, not sure what's up with that...) As for AssetsTools.NET, make sure you build the latest from GitHub since the NuGet version still needs to be updated.

# Just need the latest dumps?

Check the release section.
